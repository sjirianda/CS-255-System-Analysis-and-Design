1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
This project focused on developing an application for the company "DriverPass." DriverPass is a driver's education school that offers students videos, practice tests, real-world driving experience, and preparation for the DMV driving test. The online application serves as a central hub where students can access all these resources in one place.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I effectively prioritized the client's requirements, ensuring the design aligned with their goals. In projects like these, gathering information thoroughly is crucial to delivering a complete solution.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The aspect of this project I wish I had more time to explore is the UML class diagram. There are numerous ways to represent the various design ideas I had during this project. I would love the chance to see more of them and compare and contrast their properties.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into my system design by thoroughly reviewing the client meeting transcript multiple times to ensure I fully understood the client's expectations. This step is crucial because no matter how well a system is designed or built, it is ineffective if it ultimately misses the client's requirements.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing a system, I consider how I would personally like to interact with it and what functionalities I would want it to have. Taking on the role of the potential user helps staying organized and logical.
